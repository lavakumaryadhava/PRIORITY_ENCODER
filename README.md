# AIM
To design and simulate Priority Encoder using vivado 2023.2.
# Software Required:
vivado 2023.2 software.

# Procedure:
STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project.

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed.

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.

STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.

STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.

STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.

# PROGRAM
```
module encoder(d,a,b,c);
input [7:0]d;
output a,b,c;
or(a,d[4],d[5],d[6],d[7]);
or(b,d[2],d[3],d[6],d[7]);
or(c,d[1],d[3],d[5],d[7]);
endmodule
```
